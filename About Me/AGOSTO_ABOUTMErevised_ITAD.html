	 My birth mother didn't know how she would raise me so she gave me to my stepmother.<sup>1</sup> I was adopted by my stepmother and she gave me a name which is Joan Christine Agosto.<sup>2</sup> That time I don't know how I will react because I'm only 1 and I don’t know what is going on at that time.<sup>3</sup> But when I was in kindergarten there’s a lady always coming to our Lola’s house and she would give me snacks.<sup>4</sup> I don’t know why she would do that but my stepmother explained to me that the lady who always comes into our house is my birth mother.<sup>5</sup> At that time I didn't believe my stepmother and I just cried but the day came my birth mother was ready to take me but I don’t want to cause that time my only family in my life is the family of my stepmother.<sup>6</sup> When my birth mother sees that I don’t want to come to her she leaves and never comes back again.<sup>7</sup> When I was a child I didn't really have a friend because I’m a home buddy but I have my cousin’s that time to play with me.<sup>8</sup> I’m happy in my family but I cry a lot when I was a child because sometimes when they scold me they will bring up the past which is I’m adopted.<sup>9</sup> Then my stepfather appear in our house then our life has changed.<sup>10</sup> When I was 10 years old my stepfather sometimes hurt me and he even hangs me upside down that time I was crying so hard but my stepmother is right there to save me from my stepfather.<sup>11</sup> When I was 7 years old, I love seating in my Lola’s rocking chair but it broke when my brother pranking me.<sup>12</sup> When I was 8 years old, I always pretended to be asleep so that my stepmom which is currently my mom won’t scold me.<sup>13</sup> When I was in grade 3, I see a lot of students having a box that has a spider inside then when the class end they will go out and they will open the box so that the spider will come out.<sup>14</sup> The students will find someone that wants to fight her/his spider and they will have a bet which spider will win.<sup>15</sup> And of course I’m curious about it so I bought one, when I came home my mother saw it and she immediately said that I should throw it away but I don’t want to because I just bought it but I don’t have a choice so that I throw it in the garbage can.<sup>16</sup> I remember vividly how my mother scolded me when I tripped while playing in the cemetery.<sup>17</sup> My <em>childhood</em> wasn’t as fun and as memorable compared to other kids but I can say that I was very thankful for it.<sup>18</sup> Thankful that there is a family that accepted me and took great care of me, and I may say that I am one of the lucky ones.<sup>19</sup> To sum everything up I was an introverted kid who enjoyed staying at home and spend time with my cousins and my grandparents.<sup>20</sup>

    <h2>Teenage Years</h2>

        <p>
		<em>Teenage life</em> is where I discover the things that I’m not aware of in my entire life.<sup>1</sup> When I started my junior year, I just realized how everything has changed when you grow up.<sup>2</sup> The things and scenarios that you will never feel when you are an elementary student.<sup>3</sup> This is the start of my year again where I develop myself more because you can’t just stay as a child we have to grow up.<sup>4</sup> When my father left my mother again because he has a second family but the legal wife is my mother.<sup>5</sup> My mother raised us without the help of my father even though she is tired, she will work hard for us that's why I love my mom.<sup>6</sup> I started to understand that we don’t have a lot of money and sometimes my mother can’t give us what we want but even though our situations are like that I am happy in my family and I’m super blessed because they adopt me.<sup>7</sup> I started to have a lot of friends when I entered high school, we will go to different places so that we can have some fun.<sup>8</sup> I thought they will be my best friends until the end but I didn’t expect that they will talk behind my back.<sup>9</sup> In our junior high school moving up it ends up I don’t have someone to talk to because they don’t want to talk to me and I just realized that when you achieve something they will find a way to bring you down.<sup>10</sup> In grade 11, I thought it will be a bad year for me because of the new school and new faces but I didn’t expect it will be a happy year for me.<sup>11</sup> I started to have friends that I can trust, and they are also my eating buddy.<sup>12</sup> It is also the year that I rebel, I tried to smoke and drink so that I can forget my problems.<sup>13</sup> Every Friday when our class ended we will come to our friend’s house so that our drinking session will begin.<sup>14</sup> I thought I’m happy when I hang out with my friends, drinking alcohol, and smoking, but I don’t, I just want to escape the problem at home.<sup>15</sup> I just don’t want to hear the hurtful word about me and I just don’t want to hear how much they regret that they took me.<sup>16</sup> But I quit smoking because my mom found out and I don’t quit drinking alcohol, I just do that if there is a celebration.<sup>17</sup> Before the day of the graduation I and my best friend had a quarrel and I found out that she was talking behind my back.<sup>18</sup> All those years I thought she’s a good friend and I trusted her so much but I was wrong.<sup>19</sup> My senior high school days were like a roller coaster there were a lot of ups and downs but even though I experience that I don’t regret it because it made me who I am right now.<sup>20</sup>

       <p>
		I know that <em>college</em> will be a roller coaster ride for me but I continue.<sup>1</sup> The first time I entered UE is when I took the entrance exam, of course, I feel nervous that time because I’m not ready, I don’t have a review that time but thank God I passed the exam.<sup>2</sup> I feel anxious on my first day because it’s a new environment to me but of course I’m a bit happy cause my friend in senior high is my classmate like we are in the same section.<sup>3</sup> Of course as I enter the school,  I saw a lot of students going to their respective classrooms and some of them having a small chat with their friends.<sup>4</sup> Before I and Joshua enter the room the first classmate and friend that we encountered is Nina.<sup>5</sup> As we enter our classroom I feel the tension (charot ahhahahaha) of course we don’t know the name of students inside of that classroom.<sup>6</sup> We have a group who keeps supporting and giving good vibes to lighten up our day.<sup>7</sup> We always eat outside and of course, we have a lot of bonding together and because of that my tummy is always bloated.<sup>8 </sup> So fast forward, first-year second sem, I was separated from my friends (-_-), of course, I was sad and lonely that time but I’m super happy because my crush and I are in the same SECTION.<sup>9</sup> The name of my crush is Sean Edward Umali (taray diba full name hahahahaha ganito yata kapag kinikilig) we become close, and the day comes when he asked me about my crush, of course, I was shaking (sino ba hindi magugulat tinanong ka ng crush mo about sa crush mo samantalang yung crush mo ay yung nagtatanong) and because of that I confess my feeling to him but with a twist.<sup>10</sup> I thought he will avoid me because of my sudden confession but he didn’t.<sup>11</sup> He always talks to me and we become clingy to each other to the point that you will think that we are a couple.<sup>12</sup> He asked me on a date (date agad hahahahah) and I said “sure”, of course, I’m super duper happy that time and guess what happened next? Gosh he suddenly confessed to me.<sup>13</sup> I cannot explain my emotions that time.<sup>14</sup> I don’t know if magugulat ako or kikiligin but I’m happy.<sup>15</sup> So fast forward, so we got married (charot), So my birthday come of course I cannot forget how he surprised me that day.<sup>16</sup> Then December 21 we became officially in a relationship.<sup>17</sup> I’m currently in my second year and our relationship is still ongoing and  I wish it will not last.<sup>18</sup> I really love him and I’m super lucky that I have him in my life.<sup>19</sup> Being in a relationship is like a roller-coaster ride there’s a lot of ups and downs but this will be the reason that our relationship will become stronger.<sup>20</sup>
