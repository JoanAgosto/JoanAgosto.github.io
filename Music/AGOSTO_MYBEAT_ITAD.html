	<h4>Better off Dead - Sleeping with Sirens</h4>
	<blockquote>This song is about a depressed female, whose unhappiness is so much that she's about to end her life. Her depression is visualized during the video by means of a haunted house sucking a girl into the depths of its basement. "I think this video does an amazing job at capturing the concept of the song," said vocalist Kellin Quinn. "I thought it would be interesting to look at the idea of depression as being trapped and feeling helpless, and I think the video captures that in a unique way. I'm getting more involved in the ideas for our videos and I really enjoy that part!"</blockquote>

	<h4>Numb - Linkin Park</h4>
	<blockquote>This is about children who are sick of living up to the high expectations their parents set for them. The lyric "Every step that I take is another mistake to you" is about how they feel like they can't do anything to make their parents proud. Linkin Park collaborated with Jay-Z to record a new version called "Numb/Encore" ("Encore" is from Jay-Z's 2003 The Black Album). Jay-Z handpicked Linkin Park as his partners for an MTV project that was supposed to involve bands creating mashups for an album and performing them on a TV special. Instead, Jay-Z and Linkin Park took over the whole thing and released their own mashup EP, Collision Course, and got their own half-hour MTV special.
